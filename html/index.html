	<h1>Welcome to Jacky's web page</h1>
	<h3>Web and Internet</h3>
	<p>
		I wandered, lonely as a cloud
		That floats on high o'er vales and hills
		When all at once I saw a crowd
		A host of golden daffodils
		Beside the lake, beneath the trees
		Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

	<h3>Mobile apps</h3>

		Continuous as the stars that shine
		And twinkle on the milky way
		They stretched in never ending line
		Along the margin of the bay
		Ten thousand saw I at a glance
		Tossing their heads in spritely dance
	</p>

		The waves beside them danced
		But they outdid the sparkling waves in glee
		A poet could not but be gay
		In such a jocund company.
		I gazed and gazed, but little thought
		What wealth the show to me had brought

		For oft, when on my couch I lie
		In vacant, or in pensive mood,
		They flash upon that inward eye
		Which is the bliss of solitude,
		And then my heart with pleasure fills
		And dances with the daffodils
